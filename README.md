# Some disk metrics plugins for the datadog agent

I kinda want to know about the health of my home system, so I wrote
these checks. THey kinda measure the right thing for the disks that
I'm running, but your requirements may differ, so please use with
caution.

Also, they use `sudo`, so you will need a sudoers file, provided in
examples/.
